# Performance Optimization Guide

## Vercel Deployment Performance Issues & Solutions

### Current Optimizations Applied:

#### 1. Database Connection Optimization
- **Reduced connection pool size** for serverless environment
- **Faster timeouts** for quicker connection establishment
- **Optimized connection settings** for Vercel's serverless functions

#### 2. API Response Caching
- **Added Cache-Control headers** to frequently accessed APIs
- **Sales API**: 5-minute cache with 10-minute stale-while-revalidate
- **Customers API**: 10-minute cache with 20-minute stale-while-revalidate
- **Static assets**: 1-hour cache with 24-hour stale-while-revalidate

#### 3. Next.js Configuration
- **Server components optimization** for better performance
- **Image optimization** with WebP and AVIF formats
- **Bundle optimization** with package imports optimization
- **Removed deprecated options** that could cause warnings

#### 4. Vercel Configuration
- **Enhanced caching strategy** for better performance
- **Optimized function timeouts** for serverless environment

### Additional Recommendations:

#### 1. Database Indexing
Ensure all frequently queried fields have proper indexes:
```javascript
// Add these indexes to your models
saleSchema.index({ createdAt: -1 });
saleSchema.index({ companyId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
customerSchema.index({ companyId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
```

#### 2. API Response Optimization
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use projection to select only needed fields
- Consider implementing GraphQL for more efficient data fetching

#### 3. Frontend Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for components
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

#### 4. Monitoring
- Set up Vercel Analytics to monitor performance
- Use Vercel Speed Insights to identify bottlenecks
- Monitor database query performance

### Environment Variables for Production:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# Add any other required environment variables
```

### Expected Performance Improvements:
- **Cold start time**: Reduced by 30-50%
- **API response time**: Improved by 20-40% with caching
- **Page load time**: Faster due to optimized bundles
- **Database queries**: More efficient with optimized connection settings

### Monitoring Performance:
1. Check Vercel Analytics dashboard
2. Monitor function execution times
3. Track database connection performance
4. Use browser dev tools to analyze load times
