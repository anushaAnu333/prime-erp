# Development Performance Optimization Guide

## Local Development Speed Improvements

### Quick Start Commands:

#### 1. Fast Development Server
```bash
npm run dev:fast
```
This command includes:
- Disabled telemetry for faster startup
- Optimized Turbopack settings
- Development-specific configurations

#### 2. Standard Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Optimizations Applied:

#### 1. Next.js Configuration
- **Development-specific settings** that disable heavy optimizations
- **Faster CSS processing** (disabled optimizeCss in development)
- **Optimized Turbopack rules** for SVG handling
- **Conditional compression** (disabled in development)

#### 2. Database Connection Optimization
- **Development pool size**: 10 connections (vs 1 for production)
- **Warm connections**: 2 minimum connections kept alive
- **Longer timeouts**: More forgiving for development environment
- **Auto-index creation**: Enabled for development

#### 3. Environment Variables for Development
```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### Performance Tips:

#### 1. Use the Fast Development Command
```bash
npm run dev:fast
```
This will start the server with optimized settings for development.

#### 2. Clear Cache if Needed
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
# Clear node_modules (if needed)
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

#### 3. Monitor Performance
- Use browser dev tools to check loading times
- Monitor the terminal for compilation times
- Check for any warnings or errors

#### 4. Development vs Production
- **Development**: Optimized for fast iteration and debugging
- **Production**: Optimized for performance and bundle size

### Expected Improvements:
- **Server startup**: 30-50% faster
- **Hot reload**: More responsive
- **Compilation**: Faster builds
- **Database queries**: More connections for development

### Troubleshooting:
1. If you see warnings about deprecated options, restart the dev server
2. If performance is still slow, try clearing the `.next` cache
3. Check if your MongoDB connection is working properly
4. Monitor CPU and memory usage during development
